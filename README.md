# Armbian for Orange Pi One Plus
I am making all these builds for Orange Pi One Plus, you can download those builds to use on your device. However, since this is an unofficial build, we will not be responsible for all of the above. If you are unlucky enough to encounter those things and report the issue to me, I will laugh at you...
## Install Boot
Conditions you must have:
- ISO Installation File.
- 8GB SD Card
- USB Boot Tool
  - Recommendation: Use [Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) for effective boot creation.

Perform a boot installation:
1. Plug in the SD card reader
2. Run a bootable media creation program.
3. Put the ISO file into the boot creation software.
4. Run to create the boot, and that’s it.
